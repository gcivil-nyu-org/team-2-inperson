      Shortlist™ is an education web application specializes in matching middle
      school students or parents with their desired high schools in NYC metro
      area 🌃. Different from the traditional "prune and search" edu app that
      has been existed in the past few decades, Shortlist™ feeds users around
      400 NYC public high schools using personalized algorithms and swipping
      mechanism. It allows users to categorize the schools in three different
      lists or "🚮" certain schools to minimize distractions. Each school card
      contains personalized and relevant information. Users will be able to view
      dimensions of the info that matters the most to them, based on their
      preference settings before they start swipping. Users can also click on
      each of the school cards to view more in-depth information.
    </p>
    <p class="contents">
      Each list can contain up to four different schools and users can
      personalize the lists' name, style, and priority. Once users are satisfied
      with their selections in a list, they can share such a list to their
      friends and families so that they can discuss which schools are the best
      options for their high school experience. What could be more exciting than
      talking about which high school to go together with your besties 👭👬 in a
      few months?
