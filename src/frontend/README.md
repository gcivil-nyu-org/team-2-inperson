# Shortlist Frontend

1. Javascript implementations of the Shortlist frontend
2. A framework needs to be selected (suggesting `vue.js` for now, given it's probably a faster system to learn than React, or Angular)
3. This source tree will be "built" (minimized .js) and statically bundled with the backend server deployment; scripts in /deploy/ are designed to manage that process from a local dev machine
